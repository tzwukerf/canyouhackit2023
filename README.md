# Can You Hack It 2023
Current points: 1140
Still need:
- Birthday, Secure OTP, Tiles*
- WPA2 Deauth
- Lonely Bot*
- "Frequency Analysis", Hidden Pictures
- ENIGMA, Ransom
- Debug Me

Most of the challenges I've solved I already see writeups for (although I don't use any when I solve them myself). I will be doing writeups for those I have not seen yet. The ones I have starred are the next things on my agenda that I will do a writeup on. My goal is to do Tiles, Lonely Bot, and maybe Debug Me if I really want to cross over 2000 (but if I get to that point then I'd be pressed to solve all of them but I suck at steganography though lol).
